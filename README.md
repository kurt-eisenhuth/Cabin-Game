# Open World Explorer - Prototype

A simple web-based exploration game focused on the addictive progression mechanics of open world games.

## How to Play

1. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
2. **Click and drag** on the black canvas to move your blue character around
3. **Explore** to reveal new areas (green tiles show explored territory)
4. **Discover landmarks** (colored circles) to gain XP and level up
5. **Spend skill points** to unlock abilities that make exploration more rewarding

## Core Mechanics

- **Fog of War**: Only areas you've explored are visible
- **Persistent Progress**: All discoveries and levels are permanent (not a roguelike)  
- **Landmark Variety**: 6 different types of discoveries with varying XP rewards
- **Skill Tree**: 3 skills that enhance your exploration capabilities
- **Progression**: Each level requires more XP but gives you skill points to spend

## Skills Available

- **Speed Boost** (1 point): Move twice as fast
- **Better Vision** (1 point): See much further, revealing more area
- **Explorer's Luck** (2 points): Gain 50% more XP from discoveries

## Controls

- **Click and drag** to move
- **Click skill buttons** to purchase with available skill points
- **Reset Game** button to start over with a new randomly generated world

## Files

- `index.html` - Main game interface
- `game.js` - All game logic and mechanics
- `style.css` - Clean, modern styling
- `development-notes.md` - Detailed design document

## Future Development

This prototype focuses on core exploration mechanics. Future versions will add:
- Story elements and mystery
- Day/night survival cycles  
- Resource management
- iOS native version
- Enhanced graphics and animations

**Goal**: Test if the core "just one more landmark" psychology is working before adding complexity!
