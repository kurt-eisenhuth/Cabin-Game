# Game Design Questions & Roadmap

## Scale & World Design Questions:
1. **World Size Feel**: Does the world feel too big/empty or too cramped? Should I adjust the 4000x3000 size, or change how spread out landmarks/resources are?
   - ✅ **FEEDBACK**: World size is right, character feels bigger than cabin, want slightly more resources and landmarks spread out more

2. **Movement Speed Balance**: How does the movement feel? Too slow to explore? Too fast and you miss things? Should different terrains have more dramatic speed differences?
   - ✅ **FEEDBACK**: Movement speed is ok

3. **Discovery Density**: Are you finding landmarks/resources at a good pace, or do you spend too much time wandering between discoveries?
   - ✅ **FEEDBACK**: Want slightly more resources and landmarks spread out more

## Progression & Engagement Questions:
4. **Skill Tree Satisfaction**: Which skills feel most/least rewarding? Are there skills you never want to unlock or always rush to get?
   - ✅ **FEEDBACK**: Skill tree should pop up with spacebar instead of always showing - more room for game screen

5. **Resource Purpose**: Right now resources just give XP - should they have other uses? Building? Crafting? Trading?
   - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

6. **"One More Thing" Factor**: What keeps you playing longest - discovering landmarks, collecting resources, or unlocking skills?
   - ✅ **FEEDBACK**: Need to explore psychology isn't there yet, will take time to develop

## Day/Night & Risk Questions:
7. **Time Pressure**: Does the day/night cycle create good tension or just stress? Should days be longer/shorter?
   - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

8. **Danger Balance**: Are you actually taking risks by staying out at night, or do you always play it safe?
   - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

9. **Safe Zone Size**: Is the 120px cabin radius too big/small? Should there be other safe spots in the world?
   - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

## Long-term Vision Questions:
10. **End Game**: What should happen when you've explored everything and maxed skills? New worlds? Boss fights? Building systems?
    - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

11. **Social Elements**: Would you want to see other players' cabins/progress, or keep it solo?
    - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

12. **Platform Priority**: Still planning iOS conversion, or should we polish the web version further first?
    - ⏳ **TO DISCUSS**

## Priority Implementation List:
- [x] Fix character scale vs cabin (reduced player radius from 8 to 5)
- [x] Make skill tree toggle with spacebar (hide by default)
- [x] Increase resource count slightly (200 → 250)
- [x] Spread landmarks out more (200px → 300px minimum distance)
- [x] Remove mountains entirely, keep coherent noise-based terrain generation
- [ ] Continue working on exploration psychology

## Future Skill Ideas:
- **Mountain Climber**: "Move 50% faster through mountain terrain" - makes mountains viable routes
- **Terrain Specialist**: "No speed penalty from difficult terrain" - late game mobility
